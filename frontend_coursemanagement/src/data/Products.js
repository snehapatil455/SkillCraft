      "Figma is a web-based graphics editing and user interface design app that works on your browser.  What does that really mean?  You can access your projects from multiple devices without installing software.  You and others can work on the same file in real-time taking the project from brainstorming to prototypes.  You can use Figma to design briefs, create storyboards, reduce complexity on web sites and even design your CV or resume all while collaborating with others in real time! By the end of this project, you will go through the steps to learn about the application to develop a web page or homepage for your own app.",

      "In this  long project-based course on Javascript Fundamentals: Primitive data types, you will write your own Javascript code to better understand how primitive data types are used to create Javascript programs. You will learn the core concepts of some of the most common data types in Javascript. You will use numbers, manipulated strings and distinguish the difference between primitive and non-primitive values. Further, you will apply this knowledge to write conditional statements to discover how we utilise primitive data types to achieve real programming goals.",

By applying these concepts you can also create programs that users can interact with. These programming concepts can also be applied using other Programming Languages such as Java and Python, not just C++.",
